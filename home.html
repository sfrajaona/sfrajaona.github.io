<p class="h5">Welcome</p>
<p>I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/department-computer-science" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> of the <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">University of Surrey</a>, in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p class="h5">Academic adventure</p>
<p>
When I started my undergraduate studies in Mathematics at the University of Antananarivo in 2006, I did not know what sort of career to expect. Maths was an unpopular subject at that time in Madagascar. Most students ended up doing it only when they failed at other subjects, or when they ran out of choices. Now, more and more students would study maths to later pursue other IT studies. In 2006, I chose maths, like few of us during that time. I never dreamed to be a mathematician (I would have preferred to be a farmer if I had enough land), but I remember enjoying many–but not all– of the math topics at school. My favourite math classes were plane geometry, probability, and mechanics. I hated quadratric equations and factorisations. I also liked math puzzles, and math jokes! I came across the Three Wisemen puzzle in high school, and it never left me since then. I had it as an example in my MSc thesis, in my PhD thesis, and even during my postdoc.
</p>

<p>
Although I had no clear direction for my career during my undergrad years,
I was fortunate to get my <em>Diplome de Maîtrise en Mathematiques avec mention bien</em> in 2009 . 
A few months later, I and my future wife were selected by the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) to pursue the <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://www.aims.ac.za/structured-masters-program/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">AIMS programme</a>.
Then began my international academic adventure.
At AIMS, we had great lecturers  who taught very exciting Mathematics, like Tadashi Tokieda and Alan Beardon.
There, I also met many fellow students from many other African countries, as well as from Europe and America.
It was a great experience for me, because in Madagascar I never had the chance to meet other young Africans or Europeans. 
I decided to stay at AIMS for five more years to do my MSc and my PhD. 
I was registered at the University of Stellenbosh and I was also working as a teaching assistant at the University of Cape Town. During that time, I got married and had my first child, who now looks more like my younger brother.</p>

<p>In 2016, I moved to Germany to look after my family while my wife was working at the University of Bonn. I was a part-time guest researcher at the <a class="tc-tiddlylink-external" href="https://moves.rwth-aachen.de" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MOVES group</a> of the University of Aachen. 
After 1,5 years in Germany, we decided to go back to Madagascar.
We lived in Fort-Dauphin during the second half of 2017,
but we did not manage to get a job there.
So, we moved back to Antananarivo. I worked as a contractual lecturer at the Ecole Normale Superieure between 2018-2019. It was a great teaching experience with brilliant students, but the work conditions were hard for a contractual lecturer (<em>vacataire</em>), so I looked elsewhere. In 2020, I got my current postdoc position at the University of Surrey and the adventure continues. [Arrête de raconter ta vie!]</p>

<p class="h5">Research interests</p>
<p> My current areas of research include
<ul>
    <li>Security Protocols (formal analysis of privacy in security protocols)</li>
    <li>Multi-agent Epistemic Logics (modelling agents knowledge, knowledge dynamics, strategy, ...)</li> 
    <li> Formal Methods in Computer Science (model checking, formal program refinement, ...) </li>  
</ul>
</p>

<p class="h5">Other interests</p>
<p> Education in Madagascar.
